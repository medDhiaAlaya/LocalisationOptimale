"""
Tabu Search Implementation for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This module implements a Tabu Search algorithm to solve the TSP, which finds
the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

Time Complexity: O(i * nÂ²)
- i: number of iterations
- n: number of cities
